# Ball-game

In this code I tried to demonstrate for you a simple version of the ball game.
You can try to touch the ball, but it will still run away from you. 
But you can press the STOP button and keep pressing the button and drag the ball wherever you want.
After pressing the START button, the ball will run away from touches.
And after pressing the ZEROING button, the ball returns to its original place
and the container restores its initial background color.
That's all, I hope you like this version of my code.
